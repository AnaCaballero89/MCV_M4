Session 2

Mandatory tasks:
• Function that estimates the homography with the normalized DLT
algorithm given n ≥ 4 image correspondences.
• Complete the RANSAC function and the lab2.m file. (***DONE***)
• Compute an image mosaic with four different sets of data; compare
and comment the results (why it works or it does not work in the
different cases).
• Estimation of the homogaphy with the Gold-Standard algorithm.


Optional tasks:
• Complete the code on camera calibration using a planar pattern and
answer (in the report) two questions raised in the file lab2.m.
• Detect a logo in an image.
• Replace a logo in an image.
