%% 1. Applying image transformations

% ToDo: create the function  "apply_H" that gets as input a homography and
% an image and returns the image transformed by the homography.
% The size of the transformed image has to be automatically set so as to 
% contain the whole transformed image.
% At some point you will need to interpolate the image values at some points,
% you may use the Matlab function "interp2" for that.
